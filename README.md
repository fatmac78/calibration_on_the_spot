# Calibration on the Spot

## Introduction

The library is used to apply the Calibration-on-the-spot technique for estimation 
of the parameters of an EMCCD camera.   It is a minor modification of the supplementary software
included in the article [“Calibration-on-the-spot”: How to calibrate an EMCCD camera from its images](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28680#Sec13).  The original code may be downloaded at the following [location](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fsrep28680/MediaObjects/41598_2016_BFsrep28680_MOESM2_ESM.zip)

## Modifications

This code includes several small changes to the original: More values are returned, the code now works with Python 3.X, and a new test case has been contructed

## Installing

This requires python 3.6 +

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/fatmac78/calibration_on_the_spot.git
cd calibration_on_the_spot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

An example of the usage of the library may be found in the included test case.  The test may be run as follow:

```shell script
python -m pytest
```

The image data for the test case, representing 20 frame of output data from an EMCCD, is synthetic.  It was generated by passing 20 frames of 2-D Gaussian shaped source image input data generated by this [library](https://github.com/fatmac78/photon_generator) through different simulation runs with different gain settings from the EMCCD simulator that may be found [here](https://github.com/fatmac78/emccd_simulator)
